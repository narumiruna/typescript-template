# TypeScript Template

## Human workflow

Install dependencies, build, and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Automation

```sh
npm run ci
```

The CI command runs Biome, Vitest, and the TypeScript build. Husky runs it before each commit.

## Release workflow

Create and commit a changeset with each releasable change:

```sh
npm run changeset
```

When changesets reach `main`, [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) opens or updates a version pull request. Merging that pull request publishes the package, creates its Git tag, and creates a GitHub release.

Publishing uses npm trusted publishing. Configure the npm package's trusted publisher with this GitHub repository and the `release.yml` workflow. Also allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests in the repository's Actions settings.
